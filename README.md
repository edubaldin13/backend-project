# javascript-study -> backend
This is a repository where I construct a project backend

To start the project after cloning it into your folder, just
write "nodemon dev" on terminal to run the project

Here I use <br>
    -> VSCode <br>
    ->Javacript <br>
    ->Express <br>
    -> npm <br>
    -> MongoDB as database <br>
    -> NodeMailer to simulate a real email sender <br>
