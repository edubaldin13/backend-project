# Backend using javascript
I used this repository to apply a backend exercise using javascript

To start the project after cloning it into your folder and installing all the packages, just
write "nodemon dev" on terminal to run the project

In this project I used:
    -> VSCode as code editor
    -> Javacript as language
    -> Express as framework to create requests to the db
    -> npm as package manager
    -> MongoDB as database
    -> NodeMailer to simulate a real email sender
