# javascript-study
This is a repository where I try to put all my javascript new knowledge 

To start the project after cloning it into your folder, just
write "nodemon dev" on terminal to run the project



Here I use 
    -> VSCode 
    -> npm
    -> MongoDB as database
    -> NodeMailer to simulate a real email sender
